### Skill Improvements from Blind Testing Feedback

**SKILL.md — Financial Terminology Mapping:**
- Added comprehensive alias table mapping equivalent terms across sectors (MIP = Promote = Carried Interest Pool = LTIP = Phantom Equity, etc.)
- Covers incentive structures, waterfall/distribution terms, return metrics, and share/unit economics
- Instructs Claude to normalize all variants to standardized engine output field names

**SKILL.md — Parallelization Guidance:**
- Added section on when/how to parallelize across the 4 phases
- Phase 1: read sheets in parallel, prioritize summary tabs
- Phase 2: build multi-series engines concurrently
- Phase 3: base case sequential, then cascade tests in parallel
- Phase 4: only after engines pass eval
- Explicit warnings on when NOT to parallelize (calibration, waterfall debugging)

**SKILL.md — Cheat Sheet Pattern:**
- Added guidance to search for Summary/Cheat Sheet/Overview/Dashboard tabs before diving into detail sheets

**Eval Framework — generate-control.mjs (new):**
- Reads BASE_CASE dynamically from reference engine instead of hardcoding input ranges
- Generates test matrix centered on actual base case values with configurable ±range per input type
- Produces control-baseline.json with base case outputs and single-variable sweep results

**Eval Framework — compare-outputs.mjs (new):**
- Compares candidate engine against control baseline within configurable tolerance
- Input normalization layer with alias mapping (e.g., ownedExitMultiple = exitMultiple = capRateMultiple)
- Handles canonical-to-alias, alias-to-canonical, and sibling alias resolution
- Reports per-output and per-sweep-point pass/fail with deviation percentages

### Initial Build — Core Libraries + Templates

**Libraries:**
- `lib/irr.mjs` — Newton-Raphson IRR solver with bisection fallback, includes XIRR for irregular dates, NPV/NPV derivative utilities
- `lib/waterfall.mjs` — Generic PE distribution waterfall supporting American-style (pref + catch-up + residual) and European-style (multi-hurdle) structures. Configurable tiers with LP/GP splits, return-of-capital, catch-up provisions
- `lib/calibration.mjs` — Auto-calibration framework computing ratio/offset scale factors to align JS engine outputs with Excel targets. Includes validation and apply-calibration utilities
- `lib/excel-parser.mjs` — Excel reader using SheetJS (xlsx). Reads cells/ranges/columns, detects input cells (no formula, referenced by formulas), output cells (formula, end of chain), intermediate cells. Builds complete model-map.json with financial pattern detection (IRR, DCF, waterfall, sensitivity)

**Templates:**
- `templates/engine-template.js` — Engine skeleton with BASE_CASE, EXCEL_TARGETS, calibration initialization, `_computeRaw()` placeholder, and `computeModel()` public API
- `templates/dashboard/` — 2-tab HTML dashboard using Tailwind CDN + Chart.js. Tab 1: model explorer (output cards, input sliders, sensitivity heatmap, cash flow chart, waterfall chart). Tab 2: eval results (accuracy table, deviation chart, monotonicity/consistency checks)

**Skill:**
- `skill/SKILL.md` — Claude Code skill definition for the 4-phase pipeline (Analyze, Generate, Test, Dashboard) with detailed instructions for each phase

**Project:**
- README.md, CLAUDE.md, package.json, MIT LICENSE
- Project management files (PLAN.md, CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md)
