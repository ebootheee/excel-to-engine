# excel-to-engine — Changelog

## 2026-03-19

### Initial Build — Core Libraries + Templates

**Libraries:**
- `lib/irr.mjs` — Newton-Raphson IRR solver with bisection fallback, includes XIRR for irregular dates, NPV/NPV derivative utilities
- `lib/waterfall.mjs` — Generic PE distribution waterfall supporting American-style (pref + catch-up + residual) and European-style (multi-hurdle) structures. Configurable tiers with LP/GP splits, return-of-capital, catch-up provisions
- `lib/calibration.mjs` — Auto-calibration framework computing ratio/offset scale factors to align JS engine outputs with Excel targets. Includes validation and apply-calibration utilities
- `lib/excel-parser.mjs` — Excel reader using SheetJS (xlsx). Reads cells/ranges/columns, detects input cells (no formula, referenced by formulas), output cells (formula, end of chain), intermediate cells. Builds complete model-map.json with financial pattern detection (IRR, DCF, waterfall, sensitivity)

**Templates:**
- `templates/engine-template.js` — Engine skeleton with BASE_CASE, EXCEL_TARGETS, calibration initialization, `_computeRaw()` placeholder, and `computeModel()` public API
- `templates/dashboard/` — 2-tab HTML dashboard using Tailwind CDN + Chart.js. Tab 1: model explorer (output cards, input sliders, sensitivity heatmap, cash flow chart, waterfall chart). Tab 2: eval results (accuracy table, deviation chart, monotonicity/consistency checks)

**Skill:**
- `skill/SKILL.md` — Claude Code skill definition for the 4-phase pipeline (Analyze, Generate, Test, Dashboard) with detailed instructions for each phase

**Project:**
- README.md, CLAUDE.md, package.json, MIT LICENSE
- Project management files (PLAN.md, CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md)
