### Sheet Fingerprinting, Multi-Year Extraction & Build Log Improvements

Incorporated learnings from the Chariot NCP build (37-asset UK car park model) into the core toolkit.

**lib/excel-parser.mjs — New Features:**
- `matchLabel()` — Fuzzy label matcher with 50+ financial term aliases mapping to canonical field names (revenue, EBITDA/EBITDAR/NOI, rent, IRR, MOIC, capex, cash flow, etc.)
- `fingerprintSheet()` / `fingerprintWorkbook()` — Scans label columns across all sheets, matches to canonical fields, groups sheets by identical row patterns. Solves the #1 pain point: figuring out which rows contain which data across dozens of identical per-asset sheets
- `detectYearRow()` — Auto-detects rows with sequential year values (2023, 2024, 2025...) and maps columns to calendar years
- `extractMultiYear()` — Extracts a time series for any field across all year columns
- `extractByYear()` — Extracts all fields for a specific reference year (combines fingerprint + year detection)
- `detectEscalation()` — Computes year-over-year growth rates for any field, flags escalating values (catches rent escalation that caused 10-15% errors in the Chariot build)
- `classifyAsset()` — Auto-classifies assets as leased/managed/mixed based on rent presence, coverage ratios, and label text signals

**skill/SKILL.md — Phase 1 Improvements:**
- Added Sheet Structure Fingerprinting section with full usage examples
- Added Reference Year Selection guidance (default to first full stabilized projection year, not closing date)
- Added Cross-Sheet Validation section (validate extraction before engine generation)
- Added Asset Classification step for mixed-type portfolios
- Updated model-map.json schema to v1.1.0 with `referenceYear`, `sheetGroups`, `yearColumns`, `assets` fields
- Renumbered Phase 1 steps (1-8) to include new fingerprinting, year detection, and classification steps

**README.md:**
- Replaced ASCII architecture diagram with image (`docs/architecture.png`)
- Updated excel-parser library docs to show new fingerprinting, year detection, and classification APIs

**ROADMAP.md:**
- Added Incremental Re-extraction to Near-Term (diff model versions, generate changes report)
- Moved completed fingerprinting/classification work to Done section

### Skill Improvements from Blind Testing Feedback

**SKILL.md — Financial Terminology Mapping:**
- Added comprehensive alias table mapping equivalent terms across sectors (MIP = Promote = Carried Interest Pool = LTIP = Phantom Equity, etc.)
- Covers incentive structures, waterfall/distribution terms, return metrics, and share/unit economics
- Instructs Claude to normalize all variants to standardized engine output field names

**SKILL.md — Parallelization Guidance:**
- Added section on when/how to parallelize across the 4 phases
- Phase 1: read sheets in parallel, prioritize summary tabs
- Phase 2: build multi-series engines concurrently
- Phase 3: base case sequential, then cascade tests in parallel
- Phase 4: only after engines pass eval
- Explicit warnings on when NOT to parallelize (calibration, waterfall debugging)

**SKILL.md — Cheat Sheet Pattern:**
- Added guidance to search for Summary/Cheat Sheet/Overview/Dashboard tabs before diving into detail sheets

**Eval Framework — generate-control.mjs (new):**
- Reads BASE_CASE dynamically from reference engine instead of hardcoding input ranges
- Generates test matrix centered on actual base case values with configurable ±range per input type
- Produces control-baseline.json with base case outputs and single-variable sweep results

**Eval Framework — compare-outputs.mjs (new):**
- Compares candidate engine against control baseline within configurable tolerance
- Input normalization layer with alias mapping (e.g., ownedExitMultiple = exitMultiple = capRateMultiple)
- Handles canonical-to-alias, alias-to-canonical, and sibling alias resolution
- Reports per-output and per-sweep-point pass/fail with deviation percentages

### Initial Build — Core Libraries + Templates

**Libraries:**
- `lib/irr.mjs` — Newton-Raphson IRR solver with bisection fallback, includes XIRR for irregular dates, NPV/NPV derivative utilities
- `lib/waterfall.mjs` — Generic PE distribution waterfall supporting American-style (pref + catch-up + residual) and European-style (multi-hurdle) structures. Configurable tiers with LP/GP splits, return-of-capital, catch-up provisions
- `lib/calibration.mjs` — Auto-calibration framework computing ratio/offset scale factors to align JS engine outputs with Excel targets. Includes validation and apply-calibration utilities
- `lib/excel-parser.mjs` — Excel reader using SheetJS (xlsx). Reads cells/ranges/columns, detects input cells (no formula, referenced by formulas), output cells (formula, end of chain), intermediate cells. Builds complete model-map.json with financial pattern detection (IRR, DCF, waterfall, sensitivity)

**Templates:**
- `templates/engine-template.js` — Engine skeleton with BASE_CASE, EXCEL_TARGETS, calibration initialization, `_computeRaw()` placeholder, and `computeModel()` public API
- `templates/dashboard/` — 2-tab HTML dashboard using Tailwind CDN + Chart.js. Tab 1: model explorer (output cards, input sliders, sensitivity heatmap, cash flow chart, waterfall chart). Tab 2: eval results (accuracy table, deviation chart, monotonicity/consistency checks)

**Skill:**
- `skill/SKILL.md` — Claude Code skill definition for the 4-phase pipeline (Analyze, Generate, Test, Dashboard) with detailed instructions for each phase

**Project:**
- README.md, CLAUDE.md, package.json, MIT LICENSE
- Project management files (PLAN.md, CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md)
